# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. It will be able to work with databases, have security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization to interact with the What to Wear webpage.
## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Technologies Used
The main technology used for this project was Express, a well known framework for Node.js. I used Mongoose to from the JavaScript library to connect the database and the application. Postman was a program that was used to test requests and see responses from the server. Lastly, ESLint and Prettier were used to format the code to coding standards and find potential errors.
